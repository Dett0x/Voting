# About the Catalyst Circle #

## Origins ##

The goal of the Catalyst Circle is to act as a representative body for all of the different groups
participating in Project Catalyst. To better understand the origins and purpose of Catalyst Circle you can read the
article published by IOG entitled 
[Introducing the Catalyst Circle](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle/).

## Our Role ##

The role of Catalyst Circle is always changing. From being a "human sensor array" to exploring innovative
ways for community governance to becoming a decision-making body, the Catalyst Circle's ultimate success
depends on those who are involved. Interested individuals should have strong support within the Cardano
Community and have a solid understanding of its foundations and objectives.
