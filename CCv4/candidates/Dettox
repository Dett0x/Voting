I'm always on Twitter calling out Flaws in Cardano that get ignored because i don't have a big following.

Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst
Voter,Twitter 

What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle?
I want to point out the flaws in Cardano and try to start a conversation between Founding entities and the community so that we can be taken seriously.

How do you intend to measure your engagement. Here some examples and suggestions for effective reporting
By the changes IOG,CF,EMURGO make.

If you want to get behind pushing the idea of : 
Reducing MinFee,
Stopping CF from voting with Ada imposing their Political views on us in catalyst.
Lowering the 20% treasury tax
Changing essential parametera that haven't moved for years.
If believe in these things then I'll do my best to get the message across.
