### Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst ###

Voter, Proposer, PA, vPA, tool maker, educator

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

I will work at moving the needle on documentation & Information Gaps.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. ###

Continuous surveys, Q&A in twitter spaces and monthly after townhall.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

Via lidonation.com I've already proven my ability to bring information out of silos, organize and correlate them in a way that helps the community digest and see different angles of the data. 

As a circle rep I will work towards doing for other parts of catalyst what I've been a part of doing for proposals at lidonation.
