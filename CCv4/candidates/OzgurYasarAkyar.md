### Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst ###

I have been involved as a Voter, PA and VPA since FUND2. I'm a challenge team member in FUND7 and FUND 8

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

I have observation and participatory research experience which may help me to support a safe, lively and collaborative environment for all.

I can facilitate a digital storytelling workshops to promote the engagement of team and participants.

I further share our Catalyst Circle process with 2276 contacts in my Linkedin profile to trigger engagement and collaboration opportunities even beyond catalyst.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. ###

TownHall participation, office hours, written prioritised problems, discord call

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

It seems I'm trying to lose myself more in this deep well. If you have better candidate please don't hesitate to vote for him/her so you rescue me from the well. I wish good luck for all the candidates!
