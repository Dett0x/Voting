### Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst ###

Voter, Proposer, PA, unofficial Mentor

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

Lowering the education barriers for newcomers. Also I see businesses in the ecosystem lacking legal or sustainable strategic expertise. Thus I want to help to improve the structure of information flows, create frameworks, and foster a constructive and fair communication climate for all by helping growing the community.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. ###

Tuesdays I am hosting the new Cardano Twitter Space for German speaking folks. I am part of the European Cardano Community core team. In both I can also share Circleâ€™s progress. I am researching on DLT, EHR and SSI and started publishing them, some of the results can be found on our website https://larissa.health, some on our collaborative initiative https://ssi-did-directory.gitbook.io/open-directory-for-all/. New findings will posted there. While also contributing to the network by operating a new stake pool - Ticker BIRTH.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

I believe I am an inclusive thinking person. To my kids and my students I explained my profile as T-shaped; with the strongest background in marketing, and wings into legal, and full web stack development.
