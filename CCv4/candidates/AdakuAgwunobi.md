### Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst ###

Voter, Proposer, PA

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

I am particularly interested in the opportunity that Cardano provides to society via Proposal Assessment especially within the African continent. I love how the process also encourages blockchain education too and I think it’s really cool how it’s so similar to VC due diligence. The practice of proposal asssessment in itself is quite entrepreneurial and I believe it adds value to both the proposer and assessor. There are definitely some areas for improvements through proposal assessment that can help to shape Project Catalyst as a whole.

The foundation of Cardano is very much associated with top academic rigour. My name is Dr Adaku Jennifer Agwunobi, I have 4 degrees and was the first Black doctoral researcher to obtain a PhD at my previous campus (Loughborough University London) and I passed my PhD viva in a record breaking 2 years and 10 months. My PhD thesis entitled “Entrepreneurial health and wellbeing in the digital economy: an intersectional critical realist investigation” primarily focused on the well-being of Black female tech entrepreneurs and I also interviewed many entrepreneurs from Nigeria. I have two Master’s degree’s, the most recent being MSc Health Economics and the first being MSc Marketing. Also, my first degree was BSc (Hons) Economics! I also did a Postdoc in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford where I worked on on orthopaedic clinical tooling. One of the running themes of everything I did is the well-being of society and I truly believe Project Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem has strengths that contribute to this in a number of ways. I have a huge entrepreneurial and creative spirit alongside my strong research background. Skills that are important for Catalyst Circle.

To that end, I have the ability to bring value to Cardano in a number of ways, including sharing various community perspectives. I have been involved in the ecosystem for over a year and have particularly been strongly engaged through being a key team member of the Oxford University Cardano Student Hub.

The pursuit of exploring innovative approaches and unique ideas comes naturally to me and I have a solid understanding of its foundations and objectives. I have been impressed with the efforts in the African continent especially, as mentioned.

To that end, I have had endless experience in coordinating groups and representing them via societies (led and been active members) especially and beyond in practice. I am very analytical and can suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst. I will represent the interests of the communities that I come from and will provide my community’s perspective rather than a personal opinion.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. ###

I will measure engagement via effective reporting in a number of ways:

Firstly, I will use the template in the catalyst circle reporting repo.

* Maintain an agile backlog list to track issues between meetings
* Hold a transparent meeting every two weeks. 
* Speak to many existing and potential PA’s regarding their views on ways to improve the process. Here is where my strong research skills will really come in handy.
* I will attempt to integrate use of multimedia such as video and audio where possible to ease the process for all parties.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

Random fact: my name is Ada-ku :blush:

I am a people person and always have lots of ideas so being a part of Catalyst Circle would enable me to execute some of these ideas for the ecosystem. Very importantly, I’m a really good listener and always take the time to really consider different thoughts and ideas in a way best for the community.

Additionally, I am very creative - I sing, I write and so much more. Through my creativity, I have a unique ability to deliver information in a digestible way which helps to break down barriers to entry and thus enables more groups to get involved!
