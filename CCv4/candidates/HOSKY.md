### Describe the Community Roles in which you have participated at Project Catalyst ###

Voter

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

As a Catalyst Circle representative I would champion for improvements on the current processes that make up Project Catalyst. I would also ensure that if, and when, there is a violation of the community code of conduct is it communicated to the wider Cardano community, as accountability and transparency is a must for an ecosystem to be successful.

As with everything that has made HOSKY successful as a Catalyst Circle representative I will take the no bull s#!t approach. No fluff, no sugar coating of issues, problems, or shortcomings, and just call things as they are.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. ###

I would measure engagement of tweets related to Project Catalyst using Twitter's data analytics tools. I would also measure engagement based on attendance to Project Catalyst related Twitter spaces and or discord meetings.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

Why do I want to become a Catalyst Circle Rep? Two words: Accountability and Transparency.
