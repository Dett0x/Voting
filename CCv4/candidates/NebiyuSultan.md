### Describe Your Role in the Community ###

I have participated as a Voter, Funded Proposer, PA, Challenge Team and CCv3 Sub Circle. I also organize the Cardano Ethiopia community meetups, and actively promote every catalyst fund round to my community.

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

As the the number of proposals have reached quite a high number now, the community is getting louder in asking for results. Additionally, there are quite a few redundant projects taking place in catalyst due to lack of information on the projects that exist. 

This being said, my main focus, as a rep in catalyst circle, will be to highlight and connect the various projects in catalyst. This can be done through:

* Comprehensive database of every proposal, with relevant keywords and tags for easy search and categorization
* Candid interviews with completed/failed proposals to enable better future iterations 
* Contact information of proposers for better engagement
* Highlight and bring attention to quality projects that the community needs to be aware of
* Better layman explanations of advanced projects to ensure the community sees/understands their value

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. Here some examples and suggestions for effective reporting ###

* Community engagements will be reported through Weekly reports which will include recordings and/or minutes of the engagements
* Bi-weekly office hours will be available to conduct one-one meetings with teams or individuals, and this will be reported weekly as well through the Minutes that will be summited
* I also intend to recruit team members to work with, and I will be having weekly meetings with them and that too will be recorded.

Finally, I will be submitting monthly plans of activities for the community to easily track my progress and and give suggestions to issues that I should prioritize.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

This is my second time running for catalyst Circle, and I have been operating as sub-circle in the tool makers and maintainers sub-circle in CCv3.

I am easy going, calm and a good listener. I believe my listening skills will be valuable to identify issues and concerns that will arise in Catalyst and the wider community in general.

Through my participation in the Circle, I would like to contribute my fair share to insure that catalyst will be much more mature and developed, and that we make the best of 2023.
