### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

Plural Quadratic Voting adoption by Catalyst, IOG, and CF for Catalyst Challenges that fall into Public Good categories.

Advancing open-source ecosystem by promoting funding for the open-source community.

Growth and onboarding of new members into the Cardano and Catalyst community.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. Here some examples and suggestions for effective reporting ###

My engagement in the Catalyst Circles will be directly combined with all the open-source proposals as well as the adoption and growth proposals we got funded for. Those monthly reports and statements of intent for funded proposals are made public already.

I also plan to be quite active in Catalyst as I have demonstrated already in F8 and F9 through attending almost every town hall and every event.

I also host monthly Catalyst after town halls to discuss our progress with the community.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

Over 1.8 billion ADA and 8k unique wallets have voted Yes on our proposals to build open-source tooling and drive adoption to the Cardano ecosystem.
