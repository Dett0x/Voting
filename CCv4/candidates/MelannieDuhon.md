### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

I had the opportunity to participate in Fund 9 as a PA. It was shocking how very little was in place to ensure that the proposals were legitimate projects with verifiable proposer information. Proof of humanity needs to be step 1. Not AFTER the community blindly votes for a project they've entrusted to PAs and VPAs that have also not been vetted to assess projects. There are so many opportunities to game the system and scam the community. Nine funding rounds have passed and I plan on running the numbers to tally the amount of money that's been given out to projects that went no where.
