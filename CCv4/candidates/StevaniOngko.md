### Describe Your Role in the Community ###

Voter, PA

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

It is better if we could improve the flagging system, where the proposer can't see the score & flag an assessor by the comment only. They cannot just flag everything with low rating. Other thing, I want to help how proposer can network together to make a great project even when they stay in different places.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. Here some examples and suggestions for effective reporting ###

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

I am an Asian woman & it is good to represent my community here and build Cardano ecosystem in Asia. I am passionate for Cardano and I want to see the catalyst project could really expand the ecosystem & cut down people who just want to get benefit out of it
